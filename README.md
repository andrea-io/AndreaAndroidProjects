# Android App Development

This repository contains the work I have done while learning Android App Development starting in **December 2022**. I have previously worked on iOS App Development in Objective-C. You can find one of my major iOS app projects in this [repo](https://github.com/andrea-io/MetaU-Share-the-Table)!

As I continue to learn and improve my skills in Android App Development, I will be updating this repository with new projects and features.
